- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WAT-machine-user
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in running CI jobs for the Wide-Angle-Team.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to set myself up as a [Machine User](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users).
- I exist because github deploy keys can only be used on a single repository, and personal access tokens can only be used on all repositories.

I work in the following way: As an *outside collaborator* I have read-only access to some repositories in the @Wide-Angle-Team, specifically the WATCosmologyJuliaRegistry and LogNormalGalaxies.jl. Further, I have a dedicated SSH key that I accept for authentication, and the private key is stored as a "secret" in repositories that need access to WATCosmologyJuliaRegsitry and LogNormalGalaxies.jl. For example, MeasurePowerSpectra.jl has a secret called "SSH_KEY" that contains the private SSH key.
