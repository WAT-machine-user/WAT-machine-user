- 👋 Hi, I’m @WAT-machine-user
- 👀 I’m interested in running CI jobs for the Wide-Angle-Team.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set myself up as a [Machine User](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users).
- I exist because github deploy keys can only be used on a single repository, and personal access tokens can only be used on all repositories.

<!---
WAT-machine-user/WAT-machine-user is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
